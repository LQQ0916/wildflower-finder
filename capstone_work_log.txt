Goals:
1. Learn more about previous efforts to classify plants
    * Read several papers from the LifeCLEF projects
        * Explore ResNet as an alternative to using VGG16
            * Forked repo with ResNet 50
            * Forked repo with other ResNet models, but they are all in Caffe which has different weights than Keras and is going to be tough to sort out.
    * Registered for LifeCLEF 2017 and am downloading data
    * LifeCLEF this year did a 'predicting locations of species' project that seems very much like part of the mobile app idea I discussed with J.

2. Update README (include paragraph for Frank, one paper describing intended method, one paper from someone previously working on the problem)
    * Maybe make a readme just for Frank? The readme now has a lot on it (added proposal to readme)

3. Work on image preprocessing process. Figure out how to get ImageMagick to generate flipped/cropped/altered images for training data set.
    * Downloaded and played around with ImageMagick (made montage for readme)
        * Realized that ImageMagick won't work if image names have spaces in them (as they do, if exported from Photos), so wrote function to remove spaces and resave images. Also updated resize images functions. Both are now in img_resize.py.
    * (see below for metadata/exif)

4. Figure out how to access/save/use GPS and other metadata.
    * Tried a few options for pulling metadata out of images (must save images as pdfs for most of these to work).
        * Best (least convoluted/messy/requiring-regex) option was ImageMagick
    * Started an img_preprocessing.py file and put some starter code for running ImageMagick as subprocess in it.
    * NEW GOAL: Figure out how to read in GPS data from metadata AND figure out if it's accurate enough to group images as plant instances.
        * This could involve plotting GPS locations on a map. Look up old code on how to do this from early in g39ds?

5. Decide if it's necessary to image preprocess based on the camera used to make the image.
    * So far, none of the papers I've read have done that.
